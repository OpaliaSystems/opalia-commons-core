= commons-core

This library is a collection of patterns and utilities for Scala to solve common problems.
It provides some code patterns for developing projects with a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and helps to build a system as a collection of loosely coupled services, what makes it easy to change or replace services without affecting the rest of the system.
